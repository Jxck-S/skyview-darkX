## ⚠️ ARCHIVED - NOT MAINTAINED

**This repository is archived and kept for historical purposes only. It is not actively maintained.**

This was one of my early HTML projects created when I was new to ADS-B technology and experimentation. While it served as a learning experience, it is no longer supported or updated.

## What is Skyview?

[Skyview](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/advanced_configuration) is the local web interface for FlightAware's [dump1090-fa](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) ADS-B receiver software, which receives and decodes aircraft transponder signals.

## ⚠️ Important Recommendation

**I strongly advise against using FlightAware Skyview or other FlightAware products.**

Instead, please consider these excellent **open source alternatives**:

- **[readsb](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb)** - A high-performance ADS-B decoder (fork of dump1090)
- **[tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090)** - A modern web interface for ADS-B data with advanced features

These open source projects offer better performance, more features, active development, and full transparency.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains two dark theme variants for Skyview:
- **Green theme** - Located in `green_html/`
- **Orange theme** - Located in `orange_html/`

The `darkX_Setup.sh` script was designed to install the selected theme by replacing the default Skyview HTML files.
